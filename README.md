Hello Everyone !ðŸ‘‹
Today I'm excited to showcase Sales Analytics Dashboard ,which I built by using Microsoft Power BI. I understood that Power BI is having endless features for presenting your data analytics skills to a next level. ðŸš€
Now here are the Steps I performed for making the data analytics dashboard were :
â€¢Data Extraction
â€¢Data Transformation & Cleaning by using Power Query .
â€¢Data Modelling
â€¢DAX measures
â€¢Dashboarding
â€¢Embedding / Publishing Dashboard.
The two major concepts that I learned are: Data modelling & DAX. DAX Queries are one of most important & core concepts, making Data Processing more Efficient & can really Optimize your Dashboard/Report.
Thanks to All.
